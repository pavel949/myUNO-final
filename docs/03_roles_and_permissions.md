# 03 · Roles & Permissions

**What this document is.** Every role in the system, what it can see and do, and where — as an explicit matrix builders implement directly. The mechanism is `RoleAssignment` rows (doc 02 §2.8): **roles are data, scoped to projects and units**; permission checks read those rows through one shared helper. Nothing is visible or doable outside a role's scope.

---

## 1. Principles

1. **Deny by default.** No role row covering the scope → no access. Public pages (doc 08) are the only anonymous surface.
2. **Scope is part of the permission.** "Owner" means nothing platform-wide; it means *owner of unit X*. Every check is `can(identity, action, resource)` where the resource carries its project/unit.
3. **Roles compose.** A person holds many rows; their access is the union. The owner staying in their own unit holds `owner`(unit) + a guest-context stay — both render (v3 §23).
4. **Enforcement lives server-side** in every query/mutation (ownership-scoped `where` clauses, the pattern proven in the legacy clone) — the UI merely hides what the server would refuse.
5. **Any role consumes services.** Ordering from the marketplace requires only *some* active role in the project (or an active stay) — it is never gated to guests.
6. **Privileged actions are audit-logged** (doc 02 §10.2).

## 2. The roles

| Role | Granted how | Scope | Who this is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `Identity.is_admin` flag, set by another admin | platform | The founder / platform operator. Full access + the admin panel. |
| `staff_ops` | Granted by admin | project(s) | Operations staff: housekeeping/maintenance coordination, check-ins, TM30 filing, tickets. |
| `onsite_host` | Granted by admin | project | The on-site host/concierge: guest-facing subset of staff powers. |
| `owner` | Granted at mobilization (mandate) | unit(s) | The title-holder of a unit under any engagement type. |
| `guest` | Created automatically with a first booking; persists | project (of the stay) | A person who books/booked stays. |
| `resident` | Granted by staff, MC, or juristic person | project (+ optional unit) | Long-term tenant or owner-occupier living in the project. |
| `buyer` | Flag-role granted by admin/staff when a buyer journey starts | platform | A nurtured buyer lead (mostly informational in loop one; the transaction is Capital-led). |
| `provider_member` | Granted when a provider is activated | provider (via `provider_id`) | A person acting for a vetted provider. |
| `mc_member` | Granted by admin when an MC is onboarded | project + `organization_id` | A person acting for a management company. |
| `juristic_member` | Granted by admin | project + `organization_id` | A person acting for the project's juristic person. |

## 3. The permission matrix

Legend: ✅ allowed within scope · 👁 read-only within scope · — no access. "Own" = rows the identity created or that reference it. All actions are within the role's scoped project/unit unless marked *(platform)*.

## 4. Rules the matrix can't show

- **Ticket assignment.** Tickets are assigned to identities holding `staff_ops` or `onsite_host` in the ticket's project — or `mc_member` when the unit's engagement is `via_management_company` and the category is operational. Auto-assignment default per config `tickets.default_assignee` (doc 09 §3). The **reporter always sees status and history** regardless of assignee — that is the remote-owner transparency promise.
- **Announcement voices.** `posted_as` must match the poster's role: admins/staff post as `myuno`; `mc_member` as `management_company`; `juristic_member` as `juristic_person`. The audience selector never lets a poster reach beyond their project scope.
- **Owner read-only on operations.** Owners see everything about their unit (bookings with guest names redacted to first name + country per PDPA minimization, costs, condition, tickets, statements) but operate nothing — operations belong to staff/MC. This is deliberate: the product promise is "fully handled, and you always know how."
- **Guests and 🔒 data.** A guest sees and edits only their own party's passport data, pre-check-out. Staff access to passport fields is logged (doc 12 §5).
- **Provider blindness.** Providers see only their own services, their orders (with contact/address details exposed only between `accepted` and `fulfilled`), their reviews, and their remittance reports. They never see platform analytics, other providers, or unit records.
- **MC boundary.** An MC manages *their engaged units'* listings, availability, tickets, and ops-side bookings, and sees fee reports — but owner statements for MC-engaged units go to the **owner**; the MC sees its own fee line, not the owner's economics, unless the engagement's mandate says otherwise (config flag `engagement.via_mc.mc_sees_owner_statement`, default `false`).
- **Buyer is thin by design.** In loop one `buyer` unlocks nothing beyond what guest already has except being visible to admin in the signals funnel. It exists so the *identity* carries the state (Q1).
- **Suspension.** `Identity.status=blocked` kills all sessions and role rows' effect at the permission helper — one switch, everywhere.

## 5. Implementation contract

One helper, used by every action and route: `can(identity, action, resource) → boolean`, backed by a static `PERMISSIONS` table (action → roles → scope rule) mirroring §3 exactly, plus the special rules of §4 as named predicates. The matrix above is the test fixture: doc 16 includes a task that encodes §3 as a table-driven test suite so the matrix in code and the matrix in this document cannot drift.
